# voxel ideas

This repository provides an [issue tracker](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-ideas/issues) of open ideas for **new**
[voxel.js](http://voxeljs.com/) plugins. Feel free to open new issues for any new plugin idea you might have or
implement any of these ideas, or discuss them here.

Note this tracker is intended for new modules (possibly using
[voxel-plugins](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-plugins)) that don't exist yet, rather than suggested enhancements to
existing modules â€” which would be better tracked in their respective bug trackers.

For issues or discussion
affecting multiple projects, [voxel/issues](https://github.com/voxel/issues) may be more appropriate. But all new 
plugin ideas are welcome here in the [voxel-ideas issue tracker](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-ideas/issues).
